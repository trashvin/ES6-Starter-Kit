* Run npm start to start building in watch mode. The app can be access by default at http://localhost:8080/app
* Run npm test to check if the project builds without testing it in browser.
* Run npm build to generate build.

## Note

UglifyJS 0.4.6 doesnt support ES6, yet. Disable it if you intend to run the webpack dev server.
